A nix flake that contains examples of different programming languages.

Specifically, I want to be able to run `nix build .#python` to build and run the python example.

Every example prints a hello world and makes an computation about Collatz Conjecture. I will try to keep the examples as similar as possible.

Remaining Languages:
- Cuda
- Haskell
- Assembly
- F#
- Swift
- Bash
- Fish
- PowerShell
- Nim
- D
- Vlang
- Bend
- Nix
- Lisp
- Scheme
- Prolog
- Fortran
- Octave
