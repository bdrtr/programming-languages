A nix flake that contains examples of different programming languages.

Specifically, I want to be able to run `nix build .#python` to build and run the python example.

Every example prints a hello world and makes an computation about Collatz Conjecture. I will try to keep the examples as similar as possible.

Remaining Languages:
- Dart
- Go
- NodeJS
- Typescript
- Ruby
- Java
- Kotlin
- Cuda
- C#
- Haskell
- Assembly
- Lua
- R
- Julia
- Elixir
- Erlang
- OCaml
- F#
- Swift
- PHP
- Bash
- Fish
- PowerShell
- Nim
- Zig
- D
- Crystal
- Vlang
- Bend
- Nix
- Lisp
- Scheme
- Prolog
- Fortran
- Octave
